# Plan and Implement next steps

If the intention were to scale up to a production-quality project, my priorities and considerations would be: 
1. Improving the performance of the application - this includes optimizing the API calls, caching data, and improving the overall page load time.
2. Enhancing the user experience - this includes building better UI components and animations, improving the navigation between pages, and improving accessibility.
3. Security - this includes implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure the safety and security of the application.
4. Testing - this includes adding unit tests, end-to-end tests, and integration tests to ensure the application is functioning properly.
5. Documentation - this includes creating detailed documentation for the application, including user stories, architecture diagrams, and API documentation.
6. Scalability - this includes ensuring the application can handle increased traffic and load without compromising performance.
